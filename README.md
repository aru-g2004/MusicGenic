# MusicGenic
Here is the repo for a project that I worked on for the NextStepHacks Hackathon 2023. I worked on it with teammate Nappasorn, and we won 1st Place in this Hackathon among 250+ people. 

Music Production Made Easy!
MusicGenic is a web & cross-platform mobile application that uses artificial intelligence to make music production individualized and easy. As of now this is a running application demo but we soon plan to implement artificial intelligence in it.

The lib folder contains code for each screen in the app.
The pubspec file shows all the assets and packages used in the app.
The Images folder shows all the images used in the app.
